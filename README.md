- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, i am Simon.
I am studying at the University of MÃ¼nster in Germany. I am currently doing my bachelors in Business Informatics.
I am working mostly on frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) coding but starting to branch into backend using ruby and SQL.
I have an expertise in accessible web-design and input assistance.
